# React Native Freelancer Network

A React Native application to connect Freelance developers with employers.  

## Purpose
Current platforms to connect developers and employers are plauged by employers that want to pay as little as possible and freelancers that cant actually deliver.  Through the applications vetting/application process we seperate the wheat from the chaff.

### Prerequisites

Install npm, yarn, or whatever package manager you prefer.  Also download the expo CLI on your mobile device and create an account on the machine you code with so you can compile the code and view it live on your mobile device.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```

```

```
git clone https://github.com/curranbriant/native-talent
```

```
cd native-talent
```

```

If done successfully your browser will run the expo cli and the device will be viewable on your phone.
